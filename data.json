Through our  program, we\u2019re strategically engaging with our suppliers and elevating sustainability in our purchasing decisions to accelerate global climate action progress.\u00a0Supplier SustainabilityAs part of the mission to decarbonize our value chain, we expect our suppliers to set SBTs to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We've made a commitment that by the end of FY25, suppliers representing 60% of our applicable scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions will set their own SBTs. As of the end of FY24, suppliers that have set SBTs comprised 25% of our applicable scope 3 emissions, and suppliers with commitments to set SBTs comprised an additional 14%. We still have a large gap to close and will work diligently to empower suppliers with the tools and resources to set and progress towards SBTs.We also aim to fully integrate sustainability into our procurement strategies, operations, and decision-making. We have established a formal framework for evaluating suppliers\u2019 performance, which we use to inform supplier selection and to include sustainability as a KPI in strategic supplier business reviews.

The Exhibit can require suppliers to set SBTs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase sustainability disclosures, and deliver carbon-neutral products and services \u2013 all as part of their contractual obligations to Salesforce. In FY24, 46% of Salesforce\u2019s spend under management was with suppliers that have signed a Sustainability Exhibit with Salesforce. Tying Salesforce  to increasing spend with suppliers that have signed the Exhibit has been critical to its success. With clear support from leadership that sustainability is a priority, our teams have been able to add the Sustainability Exhibit not just to new contracts, but also as an amendment to existing contracts with many of our highest-impact suppliers.Salesforce Sustainability Exhibitexecutive compensationSuppliers tell us that Salesforce\u2019s clear call to action has been instrumental in making the business case for their own climate strategy, and pushed them to move forward with climate initiatives they weren\u2019t yet pursuing, such as setting SBTs.\fIncorporating Data Provided by SuppliersIn FY24, we enhanced our efforts to include supplier emissions data in our GHG inventory. Previously, like most companies, we estimated supplier emissions using an industry-average emissions factor multiplied by our spending in that industry. However, this approach fails to differentiate between suppliers and assumes a direct correlation between spending and emissions. This may not be the case, especially when the more sustainable option from a supplier comes at a financial premium. In other words, spending a bit more for the more carbon-friendly option isn\u2019t reflected in our GHG inventory using this approach, but instead is calculated as higher emissions.To that end, we took on the goal of establishing a methodology that allows us to incorporate more accurate carbon data from our top suppliers into our GHG inventory. Furthermore, we're collaborating with our suppliers to streamline data collection. This includes taking part in the  program, where suppliers can disclose their data to multiple customers and investors through a single platform. We\u2019re excited to announce that we have successfully developed the new methodology, which evaluates supplier-provided data for increased accuracy compared to spend-based data. In FY24, we integrated supplier-provided data for 45% of our supplier emissions, resulting in a 13% adjustment to these emissions compared to using the spend-based approach.CDP Supply ChainIn keeping with our commitment to transparency, we\u2019ve documented the methodology in a .comprehensive whitepaperIntroductionPlanetPeopleCommunitiesTechnologyGovernanceAppendixFY24 Stakeholder Impact Report13Supplier EnablementOur approach to supplier sustainability is built on understanding that sustainability is a journey and can only be successful if we work together with our stakeholders.

We provide recycling and compost collection where local infrastructure allows for \nthese services and we go to great lengths to reduce single-use plastic and food waste by offering reusable dishware, cups and cutlery, bulk snack options, and employee \nfridges for storing leftovers from catered meetings. We periodically engage in employee-facing education campaigns on proper waste sorting and waste reduction best \npractices. Our electronic waste is handled by third-party recycling vendors to ensure we are able to responsibly and securely resell or recycle as much of our hardware \nand peripheral equipment as possible. Our local workplace services teams partner with community non-profits to donate furniture, fixtures, and equipment from our \noffices whenever feasible to avoid unnecessary landfill. We try to limit our footprint at our events through a variety of practices. When planning menus, we save both \nwater and emissions by eliminating beef, pork, and almonds, and we serve meals in compostable packaging. When developing signage and branding, we prioritize \nsustainable and recyclable materials, and also plan ahead for reusability. We have increasingly minimized swag to avoid items ending up in the landfill and we work to \ninspire our community by featuring top-quality sustainability content that helps turn commitment into action.\n\n[1] Regional baseline water stress calculated via \n\nWRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas\n\n. \n\nPerformance IndicatorWater ManagementTotal water withdrawal and consumption (million gallons)[1]In regions with Extremely High baseline water stressIn regions with High baseline water stressFY241535%30%FY231263%13%FY2213019%2%FrameworkGRI 303-3, 303-5TC-SI-130a.2\fIntroduction\n\nPlanet\n\nPeople\n\nCommunities\n\nTechnology\n\nGovernance\n\nAppendix\n\nFY24 Stakeholder Impact Report\n\n75\n\nAppendix\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nAbout This Report\n\nESG Materiality\n\nSDG Index\n\nESG Metrics & Indicators\n\nPeople\n\nFramework Key\n\nGRI\n\nSASB\n\nCommitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion\n\nEquality is a core value at Salesforce.

(\u201cSalesforce\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cour\u201d) believes that values drive value, and that along with our \nProfitable Growth strategy of driving sustainable top line and bottom line progression, effectively managing our \npriority Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) topics will help create long-term value for our investors. \nOur core values of Trust, Customer Success, Innovation, Equality and Sustainability guide us as we operationalize \nthese values across our company. Transparency is a key pillar of our commitment to ESG excellence. We believe \ncompanies should clearly report progress and consistently communicate decision-useful information on ESG topics \nto their key stakeholders. Our belief is that comparable, consistent, and verified ESG disclosure is critical to \nunderstanding the long-term health and resilience of a business. \n\nThe purpose of this document is to report on and provide transparency into our calculation methodologies for \n\nselected ESG metrics, some of which are subject to a limited assurance third party review by Ernst & Young LLP \n(\u201cEY\u201d) (see Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Report at pg. 7) and to provide a brief commentary on our results \nrelative to our key environmental and social goals. Metrics included in this document have been determined based \non ESG materiality assessments and alignment to our core values of equality and sustainability. We have structured \nthis document in a manner similar to our Form 10-K, which includes a brief overview of our key programs and \ngoals, selected schedules detailing our key metrics, and footnotes that provide transparency into our calculation \nmethodology.\n\nThis document should be read in conjunction with our existing disclosures on our longstanding ESG \nprograms, which include more comprehensive reporting of our risks, overall strategy, governance structures, goals \nand results, which can be found on our website, in our annual Stakeholder Impact Report, our Climate Action Plan, \nour Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) report, our Form 10-K and our Proxy \nStatements. This document and the content of the various websites referenced throughout this document are not \nincorporated by reference and do not constitute a part of any filing we have made or will make with the SEC, \nregardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.\n\nEnvironment Overview\n\nSalesforce envisions a net zero, nature positive future for all. We operationalize sustainability into core \n\nbusiness decisions, supported by rigorous data, to drive efficiency and innovation. Our integrated sustainability \nstrategy can be found at salesforce.com/sustainability.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we maintained our achievement of three key targets: \n\n1. Maintain net zero residual emissions across our full value chain. That means we purchase carbon credits\n\nequivalent to Salesforce\u2019s residual scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. See our Sustainability FAQs for more about\nwhat net zero residual emissions means to Salesforce.\n\n2. Procure electricity or renewable energy certificates from renewable energy resources equivalent to 100\n\npercent of the electricity we used globally, calculated based on the methodology described in Notes 7 and 8\nto the Consolidated Statements of Environmental Metrics, respectively.\n\n3. Reduce our scope 1 and 2 market-based method (\u201cMBM\u201d) emissions by 50 percent ahead of our fiscal\n\n2031 target\n\nWe also made progress against a number of other environmental targets included below.\n\nAbsolute Emissions Reduction and Science-Based Targets:\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we set science-based targets (\u201cSBTs\u201d) formally with the Science Based Targets initiative \n(\u201cSBTi\u201d) covering our greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. Our five-year SBT refresh will take place in fiscal 2025. \nThese targets are intended to be consistent with reductions required to keep global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and include:\n\n1. Reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 MBM GHG emissions by 50 percent by fiscal 2031 from a fiscal 2019\n\nbase year.\n\n2. Reduce our scope 3 MBM GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related (\u201cFERA\u201d) activities by 50 percent\n\nby fiscal 2031 from a fiscal 2019 base year.\n\n3. Ensure that suppliers representing 60 percent of our applicable scope 3 location-based method (\u201cLBM\u201d)\nGHG emissions, covering purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation and\ndistribution, waste generated in operations, and upstream leased assets will set science-based targets by the\nend of fiscal 2025.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, within our Climate Action Plan, we announced our intentions to reduce our absolute emissions, \ndefined as scope 1, scope 2 LBM, and scope 3 LBM emissions from a fiscal 2019 baseline, with science-based goals \n\n3\n\n\fof a 50 percent reduction in absolute emissions by fiscal 2031 and 90 percent reduction in absolute emissions by \nfiscal 2041.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, our progress towards our selected environmental targets were as follows (emissions figures in \n\nmetric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (\u201cmt CO2e\u201d)): \n\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n\nTarget \n\n2024\n\n2023\n\n2019 \n(Base Year)\n\nNet zero residual emissions target \nNet residual emissions \n\n100 percent renewable energy target\n\nPercentage of total global electricity \nprocured from renewable energy resources\nAbsolute emissions reduction goal by fiscal 2031 (1)\n\nScope 1 emissions\nScope 2 LBM emissions\nScope 3 LBM emissions \n\nTotal absolute emissions \nIncrease (reduction) from 2019 base year\n\n(50)%\n\nScience-based targets: \nScope 1 & 2 MBM reduction target by fiscal 2031\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n610,000\n\n100%\n\n 100.0 %\n\n 100.0 %\n\n 55.0 %\n\n3,000\n315,000\n1,293,000\n1,611,000\n 26.7 %\n\n4,000\n280,000\n1,275,000\n1,559,000\n 22.6 %\n\n6,000\n322,000\n944,000\n1,272,000\nN/A\n\nScope 1 emissions\nScope 2 MBM emissions\n\nTotal Scope 1 and 2 MBM emissions\nReduction from 2019 base year\n\nScope 3 FERA reduction target by fiscal 2031\nFERA MBM Scope 3 emissions not included \nin Scope 1 and 2\nIncrease (reduction) from 2019 base year\n\nScope 3 supplier engagement target by fiscal 2025\n\nPercentage of applicable Scope 3 LBM \nemissions from suppliers with set SBTs (2)\n\n3,000\n75,000\n78,000\n (58.3) %\n\n4,000\n67,000\n71,000\n (62.0) %\n\n6,000\n181,000\n187,000\nN/A \n\n35,000 \n\n (27.1) %\n\n33,000 \n\n (31.3) %\n\n48,000\nN/A\n\n(50)%\n\n(50)%\n\n60%\n\n 25.3 %\n\n 15.8 %\n\n 1.9 %\n\n(1) The absolute emissions reduction goal of 50 percent is the near term fiscal 2031 target. The long term goal is 90\npercent reduction in absolute emissions by fiscal 2041. Both of these goals are calculated from a 2019 base year\nand are only achievable with additional innovation and investment. See Climate Action Plan for more details.\n\n(2) In fiscal 2023, we updated our supplier engagement target language with the SBTi to clearly identify the\n\ncategories covered by this target.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 and 2023 we achieved 100 percent renewable energy and net zero residual emissions. Our net \n\nzero residual emissions calculation is based on the methodology described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Statements \nof Environmental Metrics and does not currently align with the SBTi\u2019s definition of Net-Zero as published in \nOctober 2021, which outlines that in order for a company to claim net zero GHG emissions they must (1) set and \nachieve various short and long term emissions targets aligned with 1.5\u00b0C global average temperature warming and \n(2) neutralize all residual emissions through carbon dioxide removals (carbon credits associated with projects that\nremove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) after the short and long term emissions targets are achieved.\n\nWe support the SBTi\u2019s efforts and plan to achieve our near term absolute emissions reduction targets by fiscal \n2031 and 2041, respectively, ten years earlier than recommended by the SBTi, and by transitioning our carbon credit \nportfolio from avoidance to removal carbon credits over the long term. This transition may result in increased costs \nand present challenges due to our expectation that there will be limited availability of high quality removal carbon \ncredits relative to demand from corporate buyers. \n\n4\n\n\fIn fiscal 2024 and 2023, we reported an increase in absolute emissions as compared to our base year of 26.7 \npercent and 22.6 percent, respectively. These increases, compared to the base year, are largely due to the continued \ngrowth of our business; as we grow, so do our expenditures and corresponding emissions. However, in fiscal 2024, \nwe experienced a slowing in the growth of absolute emissions as a result of the Company\u2019s operational excellence \ninitiative which lead to decreased expenditures. \n\nPast emissions inventories have shown that the vast majority of our emissions occur in the upstream value \nchain, particularly in category 1 purchased goods and services. In an effort to improve the accuracy of our value \nchain emissions, we collected higher quality data with more specificity during fiscal 2024. As we transition to \nsupplier-specific data, we expect overall scope 3 emissions to decrease relative to the spend-based method due to \nengagement with our supply chain partners as demonstrated below in our scope 3 supplier engagement SBT. \nSpecifically, approximately 46 percent of our applicable upstream Scope 3 LBM emissions are calculated using the \nspend-based approach, while 52 percent were determined using the hybrid approach, and the remaining 2 percent \nwere calculated using other methodologies. Historically, the majority of our scope 3 emissions were determined \nusing the spend-based method. This approach utilizes less specific, industry-average data and serves as a screening \nprocess to determine the scale and relative magnitude of emissions. The spend-based approach and the hybrid \napproach are discussed in additional detail below.\n\nHowever, achieving our ambitious absolute emissions reduction goals remain challenging. Given the \n\ncontinued growth of our company, systemic global decarbonization is necessary. For further insights into our \nstrategies to drive these changes, refer to our Climate Action Plan, which outlines our efforts in education, \nmobilization, innovation, regulation, and policy. \n\nIn fiscal 2024 and 2023, we reported the percentage of applicable scope 3 LBM emissions from suppliers with \n\nset SBTs as 25.3 and 15.8 percent, respectively. We remain focused on supplier engagement and enablement as we \nstrive to meet the target by the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nEnvironmental Metrics - Including Looking Forward to Fiscal 2025 and Beyond\n\nWe continually review emissions quantification methodologies and are committed to implementing best \n\npractice quantification methodologies. For example, in fiscal 2024, we implemented the hybrid methodology for \nScope 3 reporting. Historically, Salesforce has calculated emissions for several scope 3 categories using the spend-\nbased method outlined in the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Calculation Guidance. This approach quantifies emissions \nusing less specific, industry-average data and serves as a screening process to determine the size and relative \nmagnitude of emissions in the upstream scope 3 categories. Past inventories confirmed the vast majority of \nemissions are in the upstream value chain, particularly in category 1, purchased goods and services. Therefore, to \nimprove the accuracy of our value-chain emissions quantification, Salesforce aims to collect higher quality, primary \ndata with more supplier specificity. Supplier-specific emissions hold a higher level of emissions data specificity \ncompared to the spend-based method. This more specific data can be obtained through a combination of resources \nsuch as CDP, direct supplier engagement, and publicly available data.\n\nAs a result of refinements to our calculation methodology and classification determinations for certain \n\ncategories, we may occasionally update our previously presented emissions.\n\nChanges in fiscal 2024 and beyond may include:\n\n\u2022 Scope 3 emissions \u2013 For specific suppliers and categories, such as purchased goods and services, we\n\nimplemented a hybrid approach as mentioned above to migrate away from purely spend-based method to\nusing emissions data obtained directly from our suppliers as more information becomes readily available.\nThis change is designed to improve the quality of data in our scope 3 emissions disclosures and affect prior\nperiod disclosures.\n\n\u2022 Base year recalculations - We updated the base year, as well as interim years\u2019, numbers to include\n\nemissions from Slack and Tableau, which were acquired in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020, respectively, and\nthe implementation of the hybrid methodology to maintain data consistency and more easily compare our\ncurrent year results.\n\n\u2022 Scope 3 MBM and LBM dual presentation - To enhance transparency, we disclosed both Market-Based\n\n(MBM) and Location-Based (LBM) emissions for our scope 3 calculations. The LBM quantifies emissions\nbased on average energy generation emission factors for defined geographic locations, including local,\nsubnational, or national boundaries whereas the MBM quantifies emissions based on GHG emissions\nemitted by the generators from which the reporter contractually purchases electricity bundled with\n\n5\n\n\fcontractual instruments, or contractual instruments on their own. While we actively pursue renewable \nenergy initiatives reflected in our MBM emissions, we recognize the importance of transparently presenting \nour emissions, irrespective of reliance on renewable energy sources.\n\n6\n\n\fEquality Overview\n\nEquality is a core value at Salesforce. We live this value by fostering a more inclusive workplace and \nadvancing greater equality in society. We remain focused on accelerating equality within our organization, across \nthe Salesforce ecosystem, and in our communities around the world.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we maintained our achievement of two key targets: \n\n1. Ensure at least 50 percent of our U.S. employees are made up of underrepresented groups\n\n(\u201cunderrepresented groups\u201d or \u201cURG\u201d), which we define as employees who identify as Women, Black,\nLatina/o/x, Indigenous, Two or more races, LGBTQ+, People with Disabilities, and Veterans.\n\n2. Double the U.S. representation of Black employees in leadership positions vice president or higher (VP+)\n\npositions, from October 2019 baseline.\n\nHowever, in fiscal 2024, Salesforce experienced a significant decrease in hiring volume as compared to \nprevious years. The functional and regional mix in hiring both in the U.S. and globally has shifted to be more \nfocused in India and on functional roles within Tech and Product. We have also experienced a significant shift in the \nCompany's focus on operating margins and business performance, which slowed momentum toward greater \nrepresentation earlier in the year. These factors impacted our ability to drive progress on URM representation in the \nU.S, resulting in not achieving our two URM targets. Going forward, driving results on our representation goals will\nrequire intentional effort across the entire Company and, as such, we are currently assessing future fiscal year\ntargets.\n\nWe also began reporting on a new goal for fiscal 2027 to achieve 40 percent Global Women and Non-binary \n\nrepresentation.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, our progress towards our selected equality goals, all of which have a target year of fiscal 2024 \n\nother than the Global Women and Non-binary representation which has a target year of 2027, were as follows: \n\nU.S. Only\n50% of workforce made of URG\n50% increase in URM (1)\n50% increase in URM leadership \n(VP+)(1)\nDouble Black leadership (VP+) (2)\nGlobal\nWomen and Non-binary representation \n(4)\n\nTarget\n\nProgress\n\nJanuary 31, \n2024\n\nJanuary, 31, \n2023\n\nBaseline (3)\n\n 50 %\nN/A\n 50 %  35.2 %\n\n 50 %  16.2 %\n 100 %  126.0 %\n\n 51.3 %\n 14.2 %\n\n 8.6 %\n 3.4 %\n\n 52.0 %\n 14.5 %\n\n 8.8 %\n 3.7 %\n\nN/A\n 10.5 %\n\n 7.4 %\n 1.5 %\n\n 40 %\n\nN/A\n\n 36.3 %\n\nN/A\n\n 36.3 %\n\n(1) Underrepresented minorities (\u201cURM\u201d) is defined as employees who identify as Black, Latina/o/x, Indigenous,\n\nand Two or more races.\n\n(2) Black leadership includes those employees who identify as Black or African American and who hold vice\n\npresident roles and higher.\n\n(3) Baseline period for URM workforce and URM in leadership (VP+) is as of July 31, 2019. Baseline period for\n\nBlack leadership (VP+) representation is as of October 31, 2019. All measurements without a baseline are a point\nin time measurement as opposed to a change.\n\n(4) Non-binary includes both \"Gender Non-Binary/Non-Conforming\" and \"Transgender.\u201d\n\nEquality Metric Measurement\n\nWe continually review our equality metric measurement and are committed to implementing best practice \ndisclosures. For example, in fiscal 2024, our disclosure of equality and diversity metrics includes all metrics as \ndefined by GRI disclosure component 405-1b, disclosing the percentage of employees by level and function across \ngender, age, and ethnicity. \n\n7\n\n\fIndependent Accountants\u2019 Review Report\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Management of Salesforce, Inc.\n\nWe have reviewed Salesforce, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cSalesforce\u201d) Consolidated Statements of Environmental\nMetrics and Consolidated Statements of Social Metrics (collectively the \u201cConsolidated\nStatements\u201d), and the related Notes to the Consolidated Statements (the \u201cSubject Matter\u201d)\nincluded in Salesforce\u2019s Schedules of Selected Environmental and Social Metrics as of and for\nthe year ended January 31, 2024, in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Notes to the\nConsolidated Statements (the \u201cCriteria\u201d). Salesforce\u2019s management is responsible for the\nSubject Matter in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on\nthe Subject Matter based on our review.\n\nOur review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C section 105, Concepts\nCommon to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about\nwhether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in\naccordance with the Criteria. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing\nfrom and are substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all\nmaterial respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an\nopinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a\nreview is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an\nexamination been performed. As such, a review does not provide assurance that we became\naware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that the\nreview evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our\nconclusion.\n\nWe are required to be independent of Salesforce and to meet our other ethical responsibilities,\nin accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our review engagement.\nAdditionally, we have complied with the other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of\nProfessional Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by\nthe AICPA.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. Our review consisted\nprincipally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the\nsubject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes\nused to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\n\nAs described in the Notes to the Consolidated Statements, the Subject Matter is subject to\nmeasurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods\nused for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement\ntechniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different\nmeasurement techniques may also vary.\n\n8\n\n\fFurthermore, Scope 3 emissions are calculated based on a significant number of estimations\nand management assumptions due to the inherent nature of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\nCorporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard as well as the Technical\nGuidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions criteria.\n\nThe information included in Salesforce\u2019s Schedules of Selected Environmental and Social\nMetrics, other than the Subject Matter, has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our\nreview and, accordingly, we express no conclusion on it.\n\nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the\nConsolidated Statements of Environmental Metrics, Consolidated Statements of Social Metrics\nand the related Notes to the Consolidated Statements as of and for the year ended January 31,\n2024 in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.\n\n\uf045\uf059\uf020\n\nSan Francisco, California\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\n9\n\n\fSalesforce, \n\nInc. \n\nConsolidated \n(in metric \n\nStatements \ntons carbon \n\nof Environmental \n\nMetrics \nequivalent) \n\ndioxide \n\nFiscal \n\n31, \nyear ended January \n\n2024  2023(3)(4) \n\n2019 \n(Base Year) (3) \n(unreviewed) \n\nEmissions \nScope 1 (1) \n\nfrom operations: \n\n3,000  4,000  6,000 \n\nScope 2 Market-Based \n\nmethod (\"MBM\") (Note 4) \n\nEmissions \n\nfrom operations \n\n75,000  67,000  181,000 \n78,000  71,000  187,000 \n\nScope 1 \nScope 2 Location-Based \nfrom operations \n\nEmissions \n\n-LBM \n\nMethod (\"LBM\") \n\n(Note 4) \n\n3,000  4,000  6,000 \n315,000 280,000 322,000 \n318,000 284,000 328,000 \n\nEmissions \n\nfrom value chain: \n\nScope 3 upstream \nScope 3 downstream emissions \n2) \n\nemissions \n-MBM \n\nEmissions \n\nfrom value \n\nchain -MBM (See Note \n\n1,021,000 988,000 750,000 \n101,000 96,000  30,000 \n1,122,000 1,084,000 917,000 \n\n-MBM \n\nScope 3 upstream \nScope 3 downstream \nEmissions \n\n-LBM \nemissions \n\nemissions \n-LBM \n-LBM (See Note 2) \n\nfrom value chain \n\nEmissions \nEmissions \n\nfrom operations \nfrom operations \n\nand value chain -MBM \nand value chain -LBM \n\n1,193,000 1,171,000 777,000 \n\n100,000 104,000 \n\n30,000 \n\n1,293,000 1,275,000 944,000 \n\n1,200,000 1,155,000 1,104,000 \n1,611,000 1,559,000 1,272,000 \n\nNeutralization and \n\nadjustments: \n\n(Note 6) \n\ncompensation \ncredits \n\nRemoval carbon \nAvoidance \n\ncarbon \n\ncredits \n(Note 7) \nemissions \n\nNet residual \n\n)  (178,000)  0 \n\n(294,000\n(906,000) (1,160,000) (344,000) \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n760,000 \n\nfrom \nelectricity \n\nprocured \n\n(Note 8) \nresources \n\ntotal global \n\nenergy \n\nPercentage of \nrenewable \nPercentage of \nsuppliers \nwith SBTs (Note 9) \nPercentage \nsuppliers \n\ncommitted \n\nof applicable \n\nscope 3 LBM emissions \n\nfrom \n\nto setting \n\nSBTs (Note 9) (2) \n\napplicable \n\nscope 3 LBM emissions \n\nfrom \n\n100 % \n\n100 % \n\n55 % \n\n25.3 % \n\n15.8 % \n\n1.9 % \n\n14.4 % \n\n35.3 % \n\nNIA \n\nfrom combusting \n\nbiodiesel \n\nand refrigerants \n\nwere excluded \n\n(1)Emissions \nbiogenic \nFor example, \nas 1,053 metric \nemissions \nseparately \n\nemissions \n\nand non-Kyoto \nfor fiscal 2024, 203 \n\ntons ofrefrigerant \n\nfrom biologically \nfrom the scopes.\n\nProtocol \n\ngases are reported \ntons of CO2 emissions \nfrom non-Kyoto \n\nseparately \nfrom combusting \ngases. \n\nmetric \nemissions \ncarbon \nsequestered \n\ndata for direct \nare reported\nCO2 from burning biomass/biofuels), \n\nEmissions \n\nProtocol \n\nCO2 \n\n(e.g., \n\nbecause \nfrom scope 1 calculations \nwith the GHG Protocol.\nwere excluded as \n\nin accordance \n\nbiodiesel \n\nthese are\n\nwell\n\n(2)Fiscal \nvalues \nincluded \n\n2023 was the first year this metric \ninclude acquisition emissions \n\ndata which is reflected \n\nwas reported. \n\nFor the base year, Fiscal \n\nbut not\nat the scope 3 value chain level above, \n\n2019, scope 3 LBM and MBM\n\nin the upstream \n\nlevel.\nand downstream \nto include \n(3)The 2019 base year was recalculated \n2023 was recalculated \n\nfor the hybrid \n\nFiscal \n\nboth the hybrid \nmethodology.\n\nmethodology \n\nand inclusion \n\nof Slack and Tableau.\n\n10\n\n\f( 4)For the fiscal year ended January \nelectricity \n\nglobal \nIndependent \n\nprocured \nAccountants' \n\nfrom renewable \nReview Report \n\nenergy \ndated March 23, 2023.\n\n31, 2023, scope 1 and scope 2 MBM emissions \n\nresources \n\nwere subjected \n\nto limited \n\nof total\nand the percentage \nRefer to the\nassurance. \n\nSee accompanying \n\nNotes to Consolidated \n\nStatements \n\nof Environmental \n\nMetrics. \n\n11 \n\n\fNotes to Consolidated \n\nSalesforce, \nStatements \n\nInc. \nof Environmental \n\nMetrics \n\n1.Summary of Business \n\nand Significant \n\nPolicies\n\nDescription \n\nof Business \n\nSalesforce, \ncompanies \n\nInc.

Through our  program, we\u2019re strategically engaging with our suppliers and elevating sustainability in our purchasing decisions to accelerate global climate action progress.\u00a0Supplier SustainabilityAs part of the mission to decarbonize our value chain, we expect our suppliers to set SBTs to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We've made a commitment that by the end of FY25, suppliers representing 60% of our applicable scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions will set their own SBTs. As of the end of FY24, suppliers that have set SBTs comprised 25% of our applicable scope 3 emissions, and suppliers with commitments to set SBTs comprised an additional 14%. We still have a large gap to close and will work diligently to empower suppliers with the tools and resources to set and progress towards SBTs.We also aim to fully integrate sustainability into our procurement strategies, operations, and decision-making. We have established a formal framework for evaluating suppliers\u2019 performance, which we use to inform supplier selection and to include sustainability as a KPI in strategic supplier business reviews. We communicate our expectations through our and a comprehensive Supplier Sustainability program guide.Supplier Code of Conduct 60%FY25FY24+17%*Target year27%*Commitments to set SBTs60%25%FY25Target YearFY24FY24 Supplier Engagement Progress+14%*PlanetAccelerating the World to Net ZeroDriving the Energy TransitionChampioning a Nature Positive FutureEnergizing the Ecopreneur RevolutionClimate Policy AdvocacySupplier CommitmentsA key way we\u2019re driving this action is by directly embedding specific, binding climate obligations into our supplier agreements with the , a set of sustainability-related contract provisions. The Exhibit can require suppliers to set SBTs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase sustainability disclosures, and deliver carbon-neutral products and services \u2013 all as part of their contractual obligations to Salesforce. In FY24, 46% of Salesforce\u2019s spend under management was with suppliers that have signed a Sustainability Exhibit with Salesforce. Tying Salesforce  to increasing spend with suppliers that have signed the Exhibit has been critical to its success. With clear support from leadership that sustainability is a priority, our teams have been able to add the Sustainability Exhibit not just to new contracts, but also as an amendment to existing contracts with many of our highest-impact suppliers.Salesforce Sustainability Exhibitexecutive compensationSuppliers tell us that Salesforce\u2019s clear call to action has been instrumental in making the business case for their own climate strategy, and pushed them to move forward with climate initiatives they weren\u2019t yet pursuing, such as setting SBTs.\fIncorporating Data Provided by SuppliersIn FY24, we enhanced our efforts to include supplier emissions data in our GHG inventory. Previously, like most companies, we estimated supplier emissions using an industry-average emissions factor multiplied by our spending in that industry. However, this approach fails to differentiate between suppliers and assumes a direct correlation between spending and emissions. This may not be the case, especially when the more sustainable option from a supplier comes at a financial premium. In other words, spending a bit more for the more carbon-friendly option isn\u2019t reflected in our GHG inventory using this approach, but instead is calculated as higher emissions.To that end, we took on the goal of establishing a methodology that allows us to incorporate more accurate carbon data from our top suppliers into our GHG inventory. Furthermore, we're collaborating with our suppliers to streamline data collection. This includes taking part in the  program, where suppliers can disclose their data to multiple customers and investors through a single platform. We\u2019re excited to announce that we have successfully developed the new methodology, which evaluates supplier-provided data for increased accuracy compared to spend-based data. In FY24, we integrated supplier-provided data for 45% of our supplier emissions, resulting in a 13% adjustment to these emissions compared to using the spend-based approach.CDP Supply ChainIn keeping with our commitment to transparency, we\u2019ve documented the methodology in a .comprehensive whitepaperIntroductionPlanetPeopleCommunitiesTechnologyGovernanceAppendixFY24 Stakeholder Impact Report13Supplier EnablementOur approach to supplier sustainability is built on understanding that sustainability is a journey and can only be successful if we work together with our stakeholders.

This year, we continued to optimize \ncircularity within our datacenter operations by \nscaling our Circular Centers, and implemented \na novel technological innovation that embeds \nsustainability guidance within our material assets. \nThis solution has further accelerated our efforts to \nreuse and recycle cloud hardware wherever possible. \n\nOur Circular Center program will support our \ntarget to reuse or recycle 90% of datacenter \ndecommissioned cloud computing hardware \nassets by 2025. \n\nImproving reuse and recycling in \ncloud hardware \n\nOur reuse and recycling rates for servers and \ncomponents across all cloud hardware reached \n89% in FY23. This progress was in large part due \nto working directly with recyclers to understand \nrecycling efficiency on Microsoft-specific equipment. \nThrough this partnership, we were able to determine \nthat Microsoft servers were on average 86% \nrecyclable, as compared to the industry average of \n67% that was previously assumed. \n\nFour Circular Centers were launched in FY22 in \nAmsterdam, Dublin, Boydton, and Singapore, with an \nadditional two in Quincy, Washington and Chicago, \nIllinois in 2023. As the program continues to expand, \nwe plan to launch two new Circular Centers in FY25 \nin England and Australia, and expand our Circular \nCenters in Amsterdam and Dublin. \n\nAdditionally, we are designing a growing portion of \nour own hardware needs and we make sustainability \nconsiderations a key part of the entire design \nprocess\u2014including energy efficiency, repairability, \nupgradability, and durability. \n\nWe continue to implement ecodesign principles and \nrequirements outlining the sustainability guidelines \nthat hardware engineers and suppliers should follow \nwhen designing hardware for the Microsoft Cloud, \nincluding Design for Serviceability specifications \nand requirements for recycled content as well as \nmaterial recyclability. \n\nWaste Table 2\u2013Improving reuse and recycling of servers and components for all \ncloud hardware \n\nIn FY23 Microsoft increased reuse and recycling of servers and components to 89.4%. \n\nA \n\nReused \n\nB \n\nRecycled \n\nFY20 \nBase \nyear \n\nFY21 \n\nFY22 \n\nFY23 \nCurrent \nyear \n\nA \n\nA \n\nA \n\nA \n\nB \n\nB \n\nB \n\nB \n\n0% \n\n20% \n\n40% \n\n60% \n\n80% \n\n90% \n\n100% \n\nTarget \n\n86.7% \n\n76.0% \n\n82.0% \n\n89.4% \n\nFind out more in our Data Fact Sheet\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOverview \n\nMicrosoft sustainability \n\nCustomer sustainability \n\nGlobal sustainability \n\nAppendix \n\n41 \n41\n\nCarbon  Water  Waste  Ecosystems \n\nAdvancing circular cloud hardware and packaging continued \n\nTo support our efforts to reuse and recycle cloud \nhardware, we developed the patent-pending \nIntelligent Disposition and Routing System (IDARS), \nwhich establishes and executes a zero waste plan \nfor our cloud hardware assets. IDARS is an end-\nto-end system that identifies the most sustainable \ndisposition path for every part at any point in its life \ncycle across the supply chain. \n\nPaired with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain \nManagement and Microsoft Power Platform, IDARS \nutilizes the bill of materials of assets, inventory, \nand demand to optimize the sustainable path, and \nprovides Circular Center technicians with precise \ninstructions on how to steward the asset onto its \nnext phase. This technology, along with our close \ncollaboration with both upstream and downstream \npartners, offers a model for the technology industry. \n\nIncreasing circularity of cloud packaging \n\nIn addition to reducing waste in cloud hardware, \nMicrosoft has the responsibility to address the \nenvironmental impact of packaging used to \ntransport cloud hardware to, from, or between \nMicrosoft datacenters. We also have an opportunity \nto utilize reusable systems to deliver sustainability \nresults and cost savings. To support Microsoft\u2019s \npublic sustainability targets, our cloud supply chain \nhas begun the sustainable transformation of our \ncloud packaging landscape. \n\nUnderstanding our packaging landscape \n\nSupporting Microsoft datacenters are over \n150 different original equipment manufacturers \n(OEMs), as well as a variety of products, services, \nand suppliers who support our cloud business. \nMultiple types of packaging are associated with \nthose products and services, which fall into two \nprimary categories: IT hardware assets that are \nintegrated into a rack and packaged together; and \nIT hardware assets that arrive at our datacenters \npackaged individually, or in groups, that are not yet \nintegrated into a rack. \n\nIn FY23, Microsoft studied its heterogeneous \nsupply chain to identify the largest producers of \npackaging waste. We found that rack packaging \ncontributes most of our waste by mass, while other \nparts arriving at our datacenters comprised the \nremaining mass. Given that Microsoft controls the \ndesign and application of rack packaging, and that \nrack packaging is the majority waste contributor \nby mass, one of our main transformation focuses \nof FY23, and continuing into FY24, will be rack \npackaging transformation. \n\nReducing, reusing, and recycling \nrack packaging \n\nTransforming the long tail \nof supplier packaging. \n\nIn many cases, parts other than racks arriving at \nour datacenters have packaging that is supplier \ndesigned and applied, preventing any unilateral \ncapabilities for Microsoft to transform the packaging \nof the products that we receive. Therefore, \ncollaboration within industry is necessary to drive \nsustainable packaging transformation. In FY23 and \ncontinuing into FY24 and beyond, Microsoft will \nclosely collaborate with our suppliers to transform \npackaging reaching our datacenters. \n\nWe are pioneering two transformative programs \nto address rack packaging waste: Sustainable \nRack Packaging transformation and Rack \nPackaging Recycling. \n\nThe innovative Sustainable Rack Packaging system \nis designed to be made predominantly from \nrecycled materials, completely devoid of single-use \nplastics, and fully repairable to prolong its lifespan. \nThe deployment of this system is estimated to \nenable us to reduce over 100,000 metric tons of \nwaste from the landfill. This kind of groundbreaking \npackaging intervention is crucial for the cloud supply \nchain to meet Microsoft\u2019s zero waste targets. \n\nBut we\u2019re not just looking to the future. We\u2019re \ndelivering results now through our Rack Packaging \nRecycling program. By partnering with our logistics \nservice providers, we\u2019ve implemented a global \nrecycling and responsible disposal program across \nour worldwide locations. This program is designed \nto mitigate the impacts of existing packaging well \nahead of the full deployment of the Sustainable Rack \nPackaging solution. In this first year of deployment, \nthe Rack Packaging Recycling program is \nforecasted to divert over 2,500 metric tons of waste \nfrom landfill. \n\nWe are pioneering two transformative programs \nto address rack packaging waste. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\fOverview \n\nMicrosoft sustainability \n\nCustomer sustainability \n\nGlobal sustainability \n\nAppendix \n\n42 \n42\n\nCarbon  Water  Waste  Ecosystems \n\nImproving device \nand packaging \ncircularity \n\nOver the past year, we have continued our work \nto reduce the environmental impacts of Microsoft \ndevices and packaging by increasing circularity and \nreducing carbon intensity across the entire product \nlife cycle. \n\n53.8% \n\nThe post-consumer recycled content used \nin our devices packaging currently stands \nat 53.8%. \n\nReducing waste in packaging design \n\nAs part of Microsoft\u2019s commitment to zero waste, \nwe are working to maximize the circularity of our \nproduct packaging. This is accomplished first by \nincreasing our use of post-consumer recycled \ncontent in the packaging materials, and second by \ndesigning packages that are recyclable in existing \ncollection systems. The post-consumer recycled \ncontent used in our devices packaging currently \nstands at 53.8%, while the calculated or theoretical \nrecyclability of our product packaging stands at 94%, \nportfolio average. Our designers and engineers work \nrelentlessly to increase use of recycled materials and \nrecyclability of packaging to support the circulation \nof packaging materials, while delivering solutions \nthat protect the product. \n\nA key pillar of our zero waste packaging strategy \nis the use of renewable and recyclable materials, \nand the elimination of single-use plastics used \nin packaging by the end of calendar year 2025. \nWe made strong headway against this goal in FY23. \nThe portfolio average of single-use plastic by weight \nwas reduced from 3.3% to 2.7%. We introduced \nseveral single-use plastic-free highly recyclable \nretail packages. These include the line of Microsoft \nAdaptive Accessories and Surface Thunderbolt\u2122 4 \nDock. The transition to sustainable wraps and bags \ncontinued with the expansion of bamboo bags \nacross our line of Surface commercial devices. \n\nPackaging continues to evolve to improve recyclability.

These not only \nhelp to minimize our impact on local habitats but \nalso may provide new ones. \n\nA primary consideration for our datacenter \nconstruction and use is biodiversity. Before any \nnew development begins, we conduct thorough \necological assessments to understand the local flora \nand fauna. This helps to ensure we are aware of, and \ncan take steps to protect, any endangered or native \nspecies in the proposed area. This process also \nresults in benchmarks for ecosystem performance \nthat help identify enhancements to improve the \nimpact of our datacenters. \n\nOur approach to land development for datacenters \nis not just about building sustainably, but about \ncoexisting harmoniously with the natural world, \nensuring that as we grow, we also give back. \nUsing the tools of biomimicry, we are assessing \nthe impact of our datacenters and identifying \nopportunities to enhance the ecosystems around us. \nAnd, as we learn from our pilots, we are exploring \nhow our designs for biodiversity can be \nimplemented across our footprint. \n\nThis effort doesn\u2019t stop at identification; we have \ndeveloped design playbooks for our internal teams \nand are actively piloting solutions that support and \nenhance local biodiversity around our datacenters. \n\nModeled results suggest that ecosystem performance \ncan be restored to as much as 75%, as evidenced by \nwhere we are able to successfully recreate 75% of the \nfunction of the untouched ecosystem. \n\n75% \n\nModeled results suggest efforts to restore and \nenhance ecosystems can recreate 75% of the \nfunction of the untouched ecosystem. \n\nOur North Holland datacenter, located near \nMiddenmeer, Netherlands, stands as an example to \nthis commitment. In collaboration with the Hollands \nKroon municipality, we embarked on an ambitious \nproject to restore and enhance the ecosystem \naround the datacenter. Initiated in early 2022, \nthe aim of Phase 1 was not only to integrate \nthe datacenter visually with the municipality \n\nbut also to create a resilient ecosystem that \nsupports biodiversity, manages stormwater, and \nprevents erosion. \n\nThe next phase will focus on soil remediation, \npreparing the ground for the introduction of diverse \nplant species aimed at attracting a broader range of \nbirds and insects. The goal is to create a year-round \nthriving environment, emphasizing the importance \nof a diverse mix of trees and shrubs for wildlife. \n\nAI\n\n Accelerating progress with AI \n\nOvercoming biodiversity bottlenecks \n\nAs we expand our footprint to meet the demand for \ncloud services, we are implementing regenerative \ndesign solutions around our datacenters that \nenhance local biodiversity, improve stormwater \nmanagement, and contribute to climate resilience. \nAs part of this initiative, we are piloting AI-driven \nMicrosoft technology to monitor and measure the \nimpact of our solutions. This is a powerful example \nof how technology can be nature positive as well. \n\nIn late 2023, we deployed our first on-campus \nMicrosoft Premonition device to pilot ecological \nmonitoring. Premonition is a biological weather \nstation that lures, monitors, and samples \ninvertebrate species to easily track ecosystem \nservices, biodiversity, and disease transmission. \n\nThis approach will allow Microsoft to measure the \nbiodiversity impact of ecological enhancement \nefforts over time and validate that the ecological \nenhancements we deploy on our datacenter \ncampuses have a positive impact on the \nlocal environment. \n\nThis innovative tool captures and analyzes a \nsegment of the insect population, providing insights \ninto the overall health of the ecosystem. As we learn \nvaluable lessons through this pilot, we are exploring \nhow these strategies can be incorporated across our \nfootprint.

This land was placed under  \ndeclaration of trust by the Belizean government, putting 9% of Belize\u2019s land under  \npermanent protection. The designation of land protection is just the first important  \nstep for the long-term conservation and management of Belize Maya Forest Project  \n(BMF). The Belize Maya Forest Trust was established as a local nonprofit, trustee, and  \nsteward to create a globally recognized, locally relevant model of healthy, biodiverse  \nforest protected for and by all Belizeans and to be a global benchmark for effective and  \nlasting conservation. \n\nRanger program \n\nTo help legally enforce forest protection,  \nthe ranger force has increased to 12 local  \nrangers patrolling the BMF. All the patrols are  \nnow being recorded using the open-source  \nSpatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool  \n(SMART) used by parks globally.

These savings \nwere achieved by shifting cargo to more carbon-\nefficient transportation modes, consolidation, \nand network design. \n\n3  Drive transformational solutions in trucking, \n\nshipping, and aviation. In partnership with our \nlargest transportation service providers, we have \nenabled them to source low-carbon or carbon-\nfree logistics services. This led to the successful \ndeployment of electric vehicles and \nsustainable fuels. \n\nTo further our goal of sustainable transportation, we \njoined collaborations like the Sustainable Aviation \nBuyers Alliance (SABA) and we have launched a new \ninitiative with cargo-owning peers and suppliers that \nplans to build the first electric interstate trucking \ncorridor in the United States. \n\nDriving targeted Scope 3 emission reductions \nrequires more precise measurement. \nFor semiconductors, this means measuring emissions \ndrivers down to the square centimeter of silicon\u2013a \nunit of measure required for life cycle assessment \n(LCA)-based methodologies\u2013and applying product-\nspecific emissions factors.

For water, \nproject design teams now create a water budget \nand water reuse plan early in the design phase. \nThe following updates are the latest in an ongoing \neffort to improve our construction standards \nand efficiency. \n\nA water budget quantifies and maps all water \nend uses and sources, potable and non-potable. \nThis allows teams to target only non-potable sources \nfor non-potable end-use and increase the use of \nrecycled water and greywater. \n\nThe new Sustainability Standards also require \nteams to develop a water reuse plan which outlines \nstrategies to reduce, capture, and reuse water on the \nconstruction site, for example, capturing stormwater \nfrom sediment ponds to be used later for dust \ncontrol and vehicle washing. \n\nAs part of our Redmond campus modernization \nproject, we\u2019ve implemented new infrastructure \nto significantly improve water use and reuse. \nThese improvements are estimated to yield over \n50% reduction in water use for the new facilities \ncompared to pre-modernization. \n\nIndoors, we estimate a reduction in water use of \nover 7 million gallons annually, through \nimplementing efficient features and constructing \ncisterns for rainwater capture. \n\nOutdoors, we estimate a reduction in irrigation \nwater of over 30 million gallons annually, through \nplanting native and adaptive vegetation as well \nas installing efficient irrigation systems. \n\nWe estimate that our Thermal Energy Center will \nhelp save over 10 million gallons of water per \nyear. The Thermal Energy Center at our Redmond \nCampus uses several unconventional approaches \nto heat rejection, including geothermal heat \nexchange, heat recovery chillers, and water \nsoftening in its cooling towers. \n\nWhile these water reduction strategies implemented \nthrough the Redmond campus modernization \nprojects are impactful, they also represent \nimportant proofs-of-concept and testing grounds, \nhelping us apply learnings and techniques to other \ncampuses globally. \n\nWater Table 1\u2013Measuring our annual \nwater consumption informs our \nreplenishment targets \n\nIn FY23, our water consumption increased in \nalignment with our business growth.

Its frontlines are not in boardrooms or government buildings\u00a0\u2014 \n\ntaking anything from the Earth.\n\nThe proof is in our products. Last year, more than 20 percent of \nthe materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled \n\nsources. MacBook Air is our first product made with more than \n\n50 percent recycled material, and we\u2019re making important strides \n\nacross all of our products. The iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch \n\nSeries\u00a09, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 use 100 percent recycled cobalt in \n\ntheir batteries. More than 99 percent of the tungsten in our products \n\ncomes from recycled sources. And we\u2019re driving innovation  \n\naround the world to improve the way our industry recycles  \n\nand recovers materials. \n\nthey\u2019re in communities. And we owe it to our global community \n\nto rise to the challenge of climate change with all the innovation, \n\nempathy, and commitment we can muster.\n\nLisa Jackson \nVP, Environment, Policy and",

He wanted to help them save money \nso they could invest in their families and their \ncommunities. He wanted to help people build \nsomething meaningful and worthwhile and to live a \nbetter life. He wanted to leave things better than he\u2019d \nfound them. That\u2019s the legacy he left our company, \nand we remain committed to being a force for good \nin the communities we serve, all over the world. \nFor Walmart, this means actively addressing the \nenvironmental and societal issues most relevant to \nour business and stakeholders, and we win when our \ncustomers, associates, suppliers, communities, and \nplanet are better off because of Walmart.\n\nIn our 61 years, we\u2019ve shown that we\u2019re capable of \nbig things. We\u2019ve embraced change and innovation \nwhile staying true to our roots, and we\u2019ve grown \nand expanded without forgetting our purpose. \nWe\u2019re a people-led, tech-powered omni-channel \nretailer dedicated to helping people save money \nand live better, and we\u2019re still built upon our original \nfoundation of timeless values. \n\nThroughout our ESG Issue Briefs and these ESG \nHighlights, you\u2019ll see the ways our commitments build \non this foundation. We\u2019ve focused on four themes \nthat guide our action: Opportunity, Sustainability, \nCommunity, and Ethics & Integrity. And at Walmart, \n\nwe\u2019re doing more than simply managing risks in these \nareas. Managing risk isn\u2019t enough. We have to think \ndifferently, and we have to do more. We have adopted \na mindset that prioritizes outcomes for business and \nsociety \u2014 and a regenerative ambition. I\u2019m proud \nof the ways our team is bringing these principles to \nlife across our business. We\u2019re giving back, and we\u2019re \nfollowing Sam\u2019s example: we\u2019re leaving things better \nthan we found them.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019re mindful that none of this \nwould be possible without our associates taking \naction and bringing these goals to life. We\u2019re grateful \nfor our associates\u2019 hard work and positive mindsets, \ntheir flexibility and their resilience, and it\u2019s important \nto Walmart that we create opportunities and invest \nin the people who have invested in our mission. \nWe want to build careers, not just jobs. In the U.S. \nalone, about 75% of salaried store, club, and supply \nchain management started their careers as hourly \nassociates. And Live Better U now allows associates \nto choose from more than 70 programs in areas like \nbusiness management and data analytics. Walmart \npays for 100% of the tuition and books. These are just \na couple of examples of our commitment to helping \nour associates live better lives, too.\n\nWe\u2019re also making progress toward our environmental \ngoals around the world. In partnership with our \nsuppliers, we\u2019ve made supply chains healthier by \nembedding regenerative practices and reducing \ncarbon emissions, and we\u2019re especially proud that \nWalmart is now three-quarters of the way toward \nreaching our Project Gigaton goal of reducing or \navoiding one billion metric tons of greenhouse gases \nby 2030. \n\nTogether, we\u2019re working every day to help people \nlive better lives, both locally and globally. That\u2019s \nthe promise we make to our stakeholders. We\u2019re \ncommitted to this mission, and we believe that our \nsuccess depends upon keeping this promise. And I \nbelieve we can do it.

NVIDIA\u2019s \ntechnological leaps in accelerated computing \nand generative AI are at the heart of a new \nindustrial revolution, fundamentally reshaping \nindustries by enhancing computing power \nand significantly advancing sustainability.\n\nThe era of generative AI is here, a \ntestament to the accelerated computing \narchitecture we envisioned years ago. Our \nbreakthroughs have significantly reduced \ncomputing costs, giving rise to a new \napproach to software development\u2014\ndeep learning. This revolutionary method \n\nallows algorithms to write software that \n\nno human can by uncovering patterns and \nrelationships in vast data sets to learn \n\nthe structure and meaning of the data.\n\nFrom steam-powered machines to electricity, \nthen the production of software, each \n\nof the first three industrial revolutions \nproduced something fundamentally new \n\nthat transformed every industry and \nsociety. We are now on the cusp of making \nsomething previously unimaginable\u2014digital \nintelligence. The generative AI revolution is \n\npoised to impact every industry and enable \na new era of productivity and sustainability \nby unlocking efficiencies and resource \noptimization across sectors. The fourth \nindustrial revolution has begun, and the world \nis embracing NVIDIA\u2019s computing platform.\n\nBy accelerating workloads with NVIDIA \nGPUs operating in parallel, we exponentially \nincrease throughput while driving down \nthe total energy used to complete a task \nand, thus, the total cost of ownership. \nThe energy savings are incredible.\n\nOur commitment to driving these \nchanges is unwavering. Our innovations \nin AI and accelerated computing are \nsetting new standards for environmental \nresponsibility while powering a \ngreener, more sustainable future.\n\nNVIDIA Accelerated Computing  \nSaves Energy\n\nThe era of CPU scaling that propelled the \ncomputer industry for decades is fading as \n\ncomputing demand skyrockets. Software \npioneers have turned to NVIDIA-pioneered \n\naccelerated computing as the path \nforward. Accelerated computing is how to \n\nmeet the massive demand for computing \npower sustainably and cost-effectively.\n\nNVIDIA accelerated computing has reached \n\nan inflection point. NVIDIA is modernizing the \nworld\u2019s trillion-dollar data center industry. \n\nAccelerated computing took workloads that \npreviously required tens of thousands of \ngeneral-purpose servers, consuming 10X to \n20X more cost and energy and compressed \nit into something incredibly dense. Each GPU \nserver is more costly and consumes more \npower, but an order of magnitude fewer \nservers are needed. So, there are enormous \nmoney and energy savings when we look at \nthe actual work done or throughput. That is \n\nprecisely why, as CPU scaling has slowed, we \nmust transition to accelerated computing\u2014we \n\ncannot continue scaling out the traditional \nway. Accelerated computing is essential.\n\nNVIDIA Accelerated Computing Is \nSustainable Computing\n\nNVIDIA already powers the most energy-\n\nefficient supercomputers in the world, which \nscientists across various fields of science \nuse to unravel the mysteries of the universe, \n\n03\n\nNVIDIA Sustainability\u2002|\u2002Message from our CEO\fMessage From \nOur CEO\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate and \nEfficiency\n\nPeople, Diversity  \nand Inclusion\n\nProduct Value \nChain\n\nResponsible \nBusiness\n\nSustainability \nIndicators\n\nharnessing the immense computational \n\npower to simulate cosmic phenomena, \ndecode genetic sequences, and predict \nclimate patterns. The Green500 evaluates \nthe world\u2019s leading supercomputers based \non their computational might and energy \nefficiency. NVIDIA technologies power 7 of the \ntop 10 systems on the latest Green500 list.\n\nData processing and management is a \n$100 billion market and a top enterprise \nworkload. NVIDIA CUDA GPUs accelerate \nthe pervasive Apache Spark data processing \nengine. Benchmark studies show that NVIDIA \naccelerated Spark can reduce the carbon \nfootprint of data processing by as much as \n80% while delivering 5X average speedups \nand 4X reductions in computing costs. \n\nPandas is the world\u2019s leading data analytics \nlibrary, used by nearly 10 million data scientists. \n\nThough easy to use, it runs only on CPUs, and \nperformance suffers from slow processing \n\nspeeds when working with large datasets. \nTo address that, we recently announced \n\nthat NVIDIA has accelerated Pandas up to \n150X for the world\u2019s nearly 10 million Pandas \n\nusers without requiring them to change \ntheir code. Considering the amount of data \nmillions of data scientists process, the time \nand energy saved will be extraordinary.\n\nTraining AI Consumes Energy \u2013 \nApplying AI Saves Energy\n\nTraining AI foundation models requires a lot \nof computing power. These requirements \nwill rise as increasingly complex models \nare trained on more data to make them \nsmarter, more useful, and safer. The models \nare learning to be more factual and reason \ndeeply to give safer, more thoughtful, and \nbetter-aligned responses. NVIDIA accelerated \ncomputing is reducing the cost and energy \nusage needed to train these foundational \nAI models with each new generation.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s new Blackwell platform is a perfect \nexample. Blackwell empowers organizations \nworldwide to build and deploy real-time \ngenerative AI powered by large, trillion-\nparameter language models. But that is only \nhalf of the story.

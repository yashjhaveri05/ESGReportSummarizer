NVIDIA\u2019s \ntechnological leaps in accelerated computing \nand generative AI are at the heart of a new \nindustrial revolution, fundamentally reshaping \nindustries by enhancing computing power \nand significantly advancing sustainability.\nThe era of generative AI is here, a \ntestament to the accelerated computing \narchitecture we envisioned years ago. Our \nbreakthroughs have significantly reduced \ncomputing costs, giving rise to a new \napproach to software development\u2014\ndeep learning. This revolutionary method \nallows algorithms to write software that \nno human can by uncovering patterns and \nrelationships in vast data sets to learn \nthe structure and meaning of the data.\nFrom steam-powered machines to electricity, \nthen the production of software, each \nof the first three industrial revolutions \nproduced something fundamentally new \nthat transformed every industry and \nsociety. We are now on the cusp of making \nsomething previously unimaginable\u2014digital \nintelligence. The generative AI revolution is \npoised to impact every industry and enable \na new era of productivity and sustainability \nby unlocking efficiencies and resource \noptimization across sectors. The fourth \nindustrial revolution has begun, and the world \nis embracing NVIDIA\u2019s computing platform.\nOur commitment to driving these \nchanges is unwavering. Our innovations \nin AI and accelerated computing are \nsetting new standards for environmental \nresponsibility while powering a \ngreener, more sustainable future.\nNVIDIA Accelerated Computing \nSaves Energy\nThe era of CPU scaling that propelled the \ncomputer industry for decades is fading as \ncomputing demand skyrockets. Software \npioneers have turned to NVIDIA-pioneered \naccelerated computing as the path \nforward. Accelerated computing is how to \nmeet the massive demand for computing \npower sustainably and cost-effectively.\nNVIDIA accelerated computing has reached \nan inflection point. NVIDIA is modernizing the \nworld\u2019s trillion-dollar data center industry. \nBy accelerating workloads with NVIDIA \nGPUs operating in parallel, we exponentially \nincrease throughput while driving down \nthe total energy used to complete a task \nand, thus, the total cost of ownership. \nThe energy savings are incredible.\nAccelerated computing took workloads that \npreviously required tens of thousands of \ngeneral-purpose servers, consuming 10X to \n20X more cost and energy and compressed \nit into something incredibly dense. Each GPU \nserver is more costly and consumes more \npower, but an order of magnitude fewer \nservers are needed. So, there are enormous \nmoney and energy savings when we look at \nthe actual work done or throughput. That is \nprecisely why, as CPU scaling has slowed, we \nmust transition to accelerated computing\u2014we \ncannot continue scaling out the traditional \nway. Accelerated computing is essential.\nNVIDIA Accelerated Computing Is \nSustainable Computing\nNVIDIA already powers the most energy-\nefficient supercomputers in the world, which \nscientists across various fields of science \nuse to unravel the mysteries of the universe,"

The Green500 evaluates \nthe world\u2019s leading supercomputers based \non their computational might and energy \nefficiency. NVIDIA technologies power 7 of the \ntop 10 systems on the latest Green500 list.\nData processing and management is a \n$100 billion market and a top enterprise \nworkload. NVIDIA CUDA GPUs accelerate \nthe pervasive Apache Spark data processing \nengine. Benchmark studies show that NVIDIA \naccelerated Spark can reduce the carbon \nfootprint of data processing by as much as \n80% while delivering 5X average speedups \nand 4X reductions in computing costs. \nPandas is the world\u2019s leading data analytics \nlibrary, used by nearly 10 million data scientists. \nThough easy to use, it runs only on CPUs, and \nperformance suffers from slow processing \nspeeds when working with large datasets. \nTo address that, we recently announced \nthat NVIDIA has accelerated Pandas up to \n150X for the world\u2019s nearly 10 million Pandas \nusers without requiring them to change \ntheir code. Considering the amount of data \nmillions of data scientists process, the time \nand energy saved will be extraordinary.\nTraining AI Consumes Energy \u2013 \nApplying AI Saves Energy\nTraining AI foundation models requires a lot \nof computing power. These requirements \nwill rise as increasingly complex models \nare trained on more data to make them \nsmarter, more useful, and safer. The models \nare learning to be more factual and reason \ndeeply to give safer, more thoughtful, and \nbetter-aligned responses. NVIDIA accelerated \ncomputing is reducing the cost and energy \nusage needed to train these foundational \nAI models with each new generation.\nNVIDIA\u2019s new Blackwell platform is a perfect \nexample. Blackwell empowers organizations \nworldwide to build and deploy real-time \ngenerative AI powered by large, trillion-\nparameter language models. But that is only \nhalf of the story. This groundbreaking platform \nalso delivers up to an order of magnitude \nlower cost and energy consumption than \nits predecessor for model processing. \nTraining models are the start of AI. The \ninvestment in the cost and energy of training \naims to create models that, when applied \nor inferencing, will help us discover better \nscientific, engineering, or operational solutions \nthat conserve energy, time, and cost.  \nThe right lens for evaluating AI costs and \nenergy is longitudinal, not just training, but \nthe long view across the entire lifecycle and \ndownstream impact of the AI model created. \nThe compounded benefits can be immense. \nWhen analyzed longitudinally, AI will be utterly \ntransformative in driving industrial productivity \nand use less energy, time, and cost.\nAI Drives Productivity, Eliminates \nWaste, Saves Energy\nWe are working with companies \nworldwide to apply AI\u2019s revolutionary \ncapabilities to save energy. \nResearchers use AI to discover safer, \nbetter-performing batteries that use fewer \nnatural resources. Microsoft and Pacific \nNorthwest National Laboratory used NVIDIA \naccelerated computing to screen over 32 \nmillion potential materials in approximately \none week. They identified 18 promising \ncandidates, including a new electrolyte \nmaterial containing lithium and sodium ions. \nThis new material reduces lithium usage by up \nto 70% compared to conventional batteries.\nEnergy companies are embracing AI to \nreduce operations\u2019 environmental footprint, \nautomating labor-intensive tasks, and \nenabling real-time intelligence at the grid \nedge. Portland General Electric is using \nNVIDIA AI inside electric meters to direct \nmore renewable energy sources into the \npower grid, reduce power outages, accelerate \nrecovery from storms, and ultimately decrease \noperational costs for the electrical grid.\nCadence creates AI chip design tools \nthat speed development and help chips \nrun faster, use less energy, and cost less. \nMediaTek, whose chips power over 2 billion \nconnected devices, has already created a \n5% smaller die and reduced power by 6% \nusing this approach. That 6% energy savings \nwill be enjoyed by millions of people. So, the \namount of energy we will save for the world \nby designing better software, chips, and \nsystems has a perpetual benefit to society. \nAI Helps Us Adapt to Climate Change\nOne of AI\u2019s most exciting applications is \nour Earth-2 platform. By teaching an AI to \nrecognize and predict weather patterns, \nNVIDIA\u2019s digital twin of our planet can \npredict atmospheric pressure, temperature, \nprecipitation, wind speed and direction, \nand humidity at an unprecedented scale \nof two kilometers.

Inside Omniverse, companies \ncan operate and optimize digital twins \nof their physical infrastructures, such \nas factories, warehouses, farms, and \nprocessing plants. These virtual replicas \nenable businesses to identify areas for \nimprovement and reduce costs, material \nconsumption, and energy usage\u2014all critical \nfactors in achieving sustainability goals.\nThe world\u2019s heavy industries represent a \nstaggering $100 trillion in value and are \nresponsible for a significant portion of global \nenergy consumption. NVIDIA can profoundly \nimpact sustainability efforts by digitalizing \nthese industries through Omniverse and \nleveraging the power of generative AI.\nA Computing Platform Shift \u2013 A New \nIndustrial Revolution\nNVIDIA accelerated computing has reached \na tipping point. Industry is urgently adopting \nNVIDIA as the same architecture is needed \nto save energy, time, and cost, as well \nas for generative AI. The combination of \naccelerated computing and generative AI \ndrives a complete full-stack computing \nplatform shift transforming every industry.\nThe new computing stack, generative AI, has \nfundamentally changed how computers work\u2014\nfrom instruction-driven to intention-driven \ncomputers. Generative AI changes how we use \ncomputers\u2014from searching and retrieving \npre-packaged content to interacting with \nreal-time generated information unique for \nevery context. Generative AI is transforming \nthe computer industry that produces \nsoftware into one that manufactures digital \nintelligence. Most importantly, generative AI \nis a new tool for scientists and engineers to \ndiscover solutions for previously intractable \nchallenges\u2014to create a sustainable future.\nI am incredibly proud of the strides we \nare making together\u2014our team, partners, \nand global community.

Information on \nmaterials we use is reported through \nvarious platforms, including Substances \nof Concern in Products and International \nMaterial Data System for automotive.\nPackaging\nWe continue to optimize the balance between \nprotecting the environment and ensuring \nthat customers receive products in like-\nnew condition. We embrace opportunities \nto reduce packaging materials and increase \nthe proportion of recycled and recyclable \nmaterials. Whether products are packaged \nfor end users or prepared for bulk shipping, \nwe strive to find the balance between \npackage density and unboxing experience.  \nIn FY24, over 90% of our NVIDIA GPU \nsystems packaging was recyclable materials \nby weight. NVIDIA continues to progress \nother sustainability initiatives such as \nidentifying opportunities to use paper-based \ncushioning in data center products, increase \npackaging recyclability, implement FSC \npaper in corrugate materials, and replace \nprinted documentation with online versions \nwhere possible. We continue to add material \nidentification codes to our packaging parts.\n90%+\nOf our NVIDIA GPU systems \npackaging was recyclable \nmaterials by weight in FY24\nTransport and Logistics\nWe plan, pack, and execute our raw \nmaterial, work-in-progress, and finished \ngoods shipments to optimize transport \nand logistics, which results in reduced fuel \nuse and less impact on the environment.\nThis includes consolidating shipping \nvolumes and weights and implementing a \nmultimodal distribution system. An area \nof continued focus is to consolidate the \nnumber of pickups and shipments.\nWe expect carriers to report shipment data \nto support carbon emissions calculations \nand have sustainability initiatives, which are \nboth covered in quarterly business reviews."

Today, it also simulates \nhuman intelligence, enabling a deeper \nunderstanding of the physical world. Its \nparallel processing capabilities, supported by \nthousands of computing cores, are essential \nfor deep learning algorithms. This form of \nAI, in which software writes itself by learning \nfrom large amounts of data, can serve as the \nbrain of computers, robots, and self-driving \ncars that can perceive and understand the \nworld. GPU-powered AI solutions are being \ndeveloped by thousands of enterprises to \ndeliver services and products that would have \nbeen immensely difficult or even impossible \nwith traditional coding. Examples include \ngenerative AI\u2014which can create new content \nsuch as text, code, images, audio, video, and \nmolecule structures\u2014and recommender \nsystems, which can suggest highly relevant \ncontent such as products, services, or ads \nusing deep neural networks trained on vast \ndatasets that capture user preferences. \nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing \ntogether hardware, systems, software, \nalgorithms, libraries, and services to create \nunique value for the markets we serve. While \nthe computing requirements of these end \nmarkets are diverse, we address them with \na unified underlying architecture leveraging \nour GPUs and networking and software \nstacks. The programmable nature of our \narchitecture allows us to support several \nmulti-billion-dollar end markets with the same \nunderlying technology by using a variety of \nsoftware stacks developed either internally \nor by third-party developers and partners. \nThe large and growing number of developers \nand installed base across our platforms \nstrengthens our ecosystem and increases \nthe value of our platform to our customers. \nInnovation is at our core. We\u2019ve invested over \n$45.3 billion in research and development \nsince our inception, yielding inventions \nthat are essential to modern computing. \nOur invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked \nthe growth of the PC gaming market and \nredefined computer graphics. With our \nintroduction of the CUDA programming model \nin 2006, we opened the parallel processing \ncapabilities of our GPU to a broad range \nof compute-intensive applications, paving \nthe way for the emergence of modern AI. In \n2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on \nNVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet computer \nimage recognition competition, marking the \n\u201cBig Bang\u201d moment of AI. We introduced our \nfirst Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the \nground up for the new era of AI, and our first \nautonomous driving system-on-chips, or SoC, \nin 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 \nexpanded our innovation canvas to include \nnetworking and led to the introduction of a \nnew processor class\u2014the data processing \nunit, or DPU. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve \nbuilt full software stacks that run on top \nof our GPUs and CUDA to bring AI to the \nworld\u2019s largest industries, including the \nNVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, \nClara for healthcare, and Omniverse for \nindustrial digitalization; and introduced the \nNVIDIA AI Enterprise software\u2014essentially \nan operating system for enterprise AI \napplications. In 2023, we introduced our \nfirst data center CPU, Grace, built for giant-\nscale AI and high-performance computing. \nNVIDIA\u2019s sustainability reporting follows our \nfiscal calendar; FY24 data corresponds to the \nperiod January 30, 2023, to January 28, 2024.\nSustainability Governance\nWe assess corporate sustainability impacts \nto identify our key social and environmental \nimpacts, leveraging stakeholder expectations, \nmarket trends, and risks as well as \nopportunities in the process. We plan to \nconduct a double-materiality assessment, \nassessing sustainability issues based on both \nfinancial and impact materiality, by the end \nour fiscal year ending January 26, 2025."

We seek to promote \nhuman rights throughout our supply chain \nand expect our suppliers to respect human \nrights whenever they provide products or \nservices for us. For our efforts related to \nhuman rights in our supply chain, see our \nHuman Rights section. NVIDIA\u2019s supplier \nselection process incorporates social and \nenvironmental factors, including risk analysis \non topics such as RBA code alignment, product \ncompliance, and environmental initiatives. \nWe hold ourselves and our suppliers to the \nhighest standards of behavior, and only \nengage suppliers that share our values. \nWe closely manage our supply chain to \ndeliver innovative products that satisfy \nour customers\u2019 expectations in a socially \nand environmentally conscious manner.\nResponsible Minerals\nNVIDIA is committed to the responsible \nsourcing of minerals. We support, contribute \nto, and rely on industry-wide efforts to \nvalidate the source of minerals used in our \nproducts, aiming to ensure that they come \nfrom socially responsible sources and do \nnot contribute to human conflict. Our goal \nis to use only conflict-free gold, tantalum, \ntungsten, and tin (3TG) in our products \nand to achieve 100% Responsible Minerals \nAssurance Process-compliant tantalum, tin, \ntungsten, and gold processing facilities.\nWe evaluate smelter metrics and share an \nannual update in our Conflict Minerals Report. \nWe\u2019ve successfully removed non-compliant \n3TG smelters and refiners in our supply \nchain to help us meet this goal. During the \nreporting period, 100% of our suppliers and \ncomponent manufacturers responded with \nthe requested information. We also collect \nnon-3TG smelter data for cobalt and mica \nfrom our strategic suppliers and report the \ninitial results to customers. As the cobalt and \nmica programs through the RBA\u2019s Responsible \nMinerals Initiative (RMI) matures, our goal is \nto only source from conflict-free refiners.\nOur Responsible Minerals Policy, sourcing \ngoals, and steps for monitoring our supply \nchain for conflict minerals is framed around \nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development (OECD) Due Diligence \nGuidance for Responsible Supply Chains of \nMinerals from Conflict-Affected and High- \nRisk Areas (CAHRA). This provides detailed \nrecommendations to help companies respect \nhuman rights and avoid contributing to \nconflict through their mineral purchasing \ndecisions and practices. Our conflict minerals \ndue diligence program conforms in all material \nrespects with the OECD framework.\nWe\u2019re a member of the Public Private Alliance \n(PPA) for Responsible Minerals Trade and \nthe RMI. The PPA provides funding and \ncoordination support to organizations \nworking within the Democratic Republic of \nCongo and adjacent countries to develop \nverifiable conflict-free supply chains, align \ndue diligence programs and practices, \nencourage responsible sourcing from the \nregion, promote transparency, and bolster \nin-region civil society and governmental \ncapacity. We support these on-the-ground \nprograms aimed at improving transparency \nfor responsible sourcing and reducing \nhuman rights risks, including forced labor."

Our supply chain is \nconcentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. We \nuse foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor \nManufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, \nand Samsung Electronics, or Samsung, to \nproduce our semiconductor wafers. We \npurchase memory from Micron Technology, \nInc., SK Hynix Inc., and Samsung. We engage \nwith independent subcontractors and contract \nmanufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision \nIndustry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, \nand Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing, \nand packaging of our final products. \nStrategic Suppliers\nStrategic suppliers include those who produce \nor handle NVIDIA production materials, \nthose for whom we closely manage quality \nrequirements, those who design our branded \nproducts, and those who we\u2019re required to \nwork with based on customer agreements.\nFor strategic suppliers, agreements are \ndeployed and tracked through a Quarterly \nBusiness Review (QBR) process to ensure they \nmeet our expectations, which may influence \nour business allocation decisions. Five percent \nof the QBR score is based on environmental \nand social performance, and expectations \nvary by quarter. Each quarter, we assess \nthese suppliers by product category and rank \nperformance, and we perform an annual risk \nassessment based on RBA results, geography, \nand type of industry. We\u2019ve assessed and \nadjusted business with suppliers who don\u2019t \ncomply with minimum requirements. \nWe review all strategic suppliers against \nNVIDIA cybersecurity requirements \nand have performed a more in-depth \nassessment of higher-risk suppliers. We \nlooked at our suppliers\u2019 conformance to \nISO 27001, ISO 28001, C-TPAT, and NIST \nstandards and evaluated them for additional \ninformation-, product-, and physical-security \nexpectations. If gaps are discovered, we \nexpect an improvement plan to align with \nNVIDIA requirements. The cybersecurity \nsurvey determines supplier risk to be \nlow, moderate, or high, and audits are \nconducted on a one- to three-year cycle.\nRisk Assessment and Auditing\nAll our manufacturing suppliers are \nexpected to comply with the RBA Code of \nConduct and associated NVIDIA policies, \nincluding our Agreement for Manufacturer \nEnvironmental Compliance. Since 2016, \nall NVIDIA Master Service Agreements \nexecuted with suppliers require compliance \nwith the RBA Code of Conduct.\nOur assessment process involves using the \nRBA-Online system to evaluate existing and \npotential new suppliers against product \ncompliance industry standards, social \nand environmental criteria, use of conflict \nminerals, the RBA Code of Conduct, and \nNVIDIA\u2019s code of conduct. All suppliers \nare expected to conduct an annual self-\nassessment questionnaire (SAQ), and we \nexpect biennial Validated Assessment \nProgram (VAP) on-site, third-party audits \nto validate the SAQ. We use the results of \nthe assessment, which includes a spending \nanalysis, to determine their overall risk. \nTo ensure consistency, suppliers can share VAP \naudits with customers. Any uncovered findings \nare also made available to those customers. \nFindings are aggregated anonymously by the \nRBA and disclosed in their public annual report.\nCommon audit findings include issues related \nto freely chosen employment, working hours, \nwages and benefits, emergency preparedness, \nand occupational safety. NVIDIA ensures \nsuppliers close all corrective actions in \ncompliance with its Full RBA membership tier.\nOur goal is to audit 100% of our \nstrategic suppliers every two years. \nIn FY24, we reviewed VAP audits \non 67% of our strategic suppliers, \nbringing total audits in the past two \nyears to 93%. We engaged 100% of \nstrategic suppliers on their corrective \naction plans and continue monitoring \nsuppliers to ensure compliance."

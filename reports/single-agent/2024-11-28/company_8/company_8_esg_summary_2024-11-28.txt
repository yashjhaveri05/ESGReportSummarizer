## Adobe ESG Score:

**Environmental: 6/10** - Adobe highlights commitment to renewable energy and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. However,  detailed information on current environmental footprint (emissions, waste, water usage) is lacking for a comprehensive assessment.

**Social: 7/10** - Adobe emphasizes "Creativity for All" and "Adobe for All," suggesting strong focus on diversity & inclusion. Initiatives like the Content Authenticity Initiative demonstrate commitment to ethical technology use. Further details on social impact metrics and employee wellbeing programs would strengthen this score.

**Governance: 8/10**  - The report mentions a governance structure focused on ESG integration, implying robust oversight mechanisms. More transparency regarding board diversity, executive compensation linked to ESG targets, and stakeholder engagement practices would enhance the score.

**Total: 7/10** - Adobe demonstrates promising commitment across all three ESG pillars. However, providing more granular data and quantifiable outcomes for social and environmental initiatives would solidify its overall ESG performance.

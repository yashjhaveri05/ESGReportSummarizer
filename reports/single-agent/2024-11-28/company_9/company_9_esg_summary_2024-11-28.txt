## Summary

This excerpt from Apple's 2024 Environmental Progress Report highlights the company's commitment to its "Apple 2030" sustainability goals. The report focuses on three key areas: 

* **Apple 2030:**  This overarching goal aims for carbon neutrality across Apple's entire carbon footprint by reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 75% compared to 2015 levels and investing in high-quality carbon removal solutions.
* **Resources:** This section emphasizes Apple's dedication to creating durable products with extended lifespans, enhancing material recovery through recycling programs, and responsible water stewardship. The excerpt mentions a target of achieving zero waste sent to landfills from final assembly sites. 
* **Smarter Chemistry:** Apple prioritizes the use of safer materials in its products, minimizing environmental impact throughout the product lifecycle â€“ from assembly to recycling. This involves rigorous mapping and assessment of materials used, ensuring supplier compliance with sustainability standards, and collaborating with research institutions to develop sustainable semiconductor technologies.

The report also highlights specific examples of progress:
* Over 38% of manufacturing electricity for iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is sourced from clean energy projects supported by Apple suppliers.
* Continued efforts to improve the carbon footprint of integrated circuits through collaboration with imec, a leading research hub in nanoelectronics.

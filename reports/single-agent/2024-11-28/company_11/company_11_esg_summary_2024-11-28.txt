## ESG Score:


**ESG Score:**
* **Environmental:** 7/10 -  Demonstrates strong commitment with measurable goals like Project Gigaton, but further details on specific initiatives and impact metrics would strengthen the score.
* **Social:** 8/10 - Robust framework for social initiatives (Live Better U, focus on career paths)  and a clear emphasis on associate well-being. Could benefit from outlining specific diversity and inclusion targets and progress.
* **Governance:** 7/10 - Mentions robust governance structure and integration of ESG into decision-making but lacks details about board composition, independence, and oversight mechanisms.

**Total: 7.3/10** 


Walmart demonstrates a strong commitment to ESG principles with notable achievements in sustainability and social responsibility. However, providing more specific data and measurable outcomes for various initiatives would further enhance their ESG score.

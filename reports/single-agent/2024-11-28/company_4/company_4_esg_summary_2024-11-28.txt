##  ESG Score:

**Environmental:** 6/10 - Meta outlines ambitious goals for net zero emissions and sustainable practices but provides limited quantitative data on current progress. Further details on specific initiatives, metrics like energy consumption and renewable energy use, and timelines for achieving targets are needed.

**Social:** 7/10 - The report highlights a strong commitment to responsible operations, including worker well-being in the supply chain. However,  more detailed information on social impact programs, diversity and inclusion efforts, and community engagement initiatives would strengthen this score.

 **Governance:** 8/10 - Meta demonstrates robust governance with dedicated oversight by the Audit and Risk Oversight Committee (AROC). The involvement of senior leaders and regular updates to the committee indicate a strong commitment to integrating ESG considerations into decision-making.


**Total: 7/10**

**Summary:**

Meta's 2024 Sustainability Report showcases a commendable commitment to environmental sustainability and responsible business practices. While the report outlines ambitious goals for net zero emissions and highlights efforts to protect workers and communities, it lacks detailed quantitative data on current progress. Providing specific metrics and timelines for achieving targets would further strengthen Meta's ESG performance.


The strong governance structure with dedicated oversight from AROC indicates a proactive approach to incorporating ESG considerations into decision-making. Further transparency on social impact programs and diversity & inclusion initiatives would enhance the overall ESG profile.

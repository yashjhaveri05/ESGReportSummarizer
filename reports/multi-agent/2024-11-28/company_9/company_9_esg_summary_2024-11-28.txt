Apple demonstrates a strong commitment to environmental sustainability through its "Apple 2030" initiative aimed at achieving carbon neutrality across its entire footprint by 2030.  Significant progress has been made in reducing carbon emissions (over 55% since 2015) and incorporating recycled materials into products, with the iPhone 15 featuring 100% recycled cobalt in its battery.

Apple prioritizes ethical sourcing practices for key materials like mica, copper, graphite, and nickel. However, the available information lacks details on board composition, executive compensation, shareholder engagement, and risk management frameworks.

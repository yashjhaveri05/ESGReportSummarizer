While you haven't provided the Social and Environmental summaries with their respective data, I can offer a framework for creating a unified ESG summary and assigning scores based on the information given about Governance:

**Unified Summary:** 

JPMorgan Chase emphasizes its commitment to supporting clients globally and contributing to a sustainable and inclusive economy. While it mentions targets for these goals, specific details regarding governance practices remain unclear.  Further information is needed on board composition, executive compensation structures, shareholder rights, ethical conduct policies, and risk management strategies to comprehensively assess JPMorgan Chase's ESG performance. 

**ESG Score:**

* **Environmental:** Unable to score without data.
* **Social:** Unable to score without data.
* **Governance:** 5/10 - The excerpt highlights a commitment to free enterprise and sustainable goals, but lacks transparency regarding concrete governance practices. More detailed information is needed on board diversity, executive compensation alignment with performance, shareholder engagement mechanisms, ethical conduct policies, and risk management frameworks to provide a more accurate assessment.
* **Total:** Unable to calculate without Environmental and Social scores.

**Note:** This score reflects the limited information provided. A complete ESG analysis requires a thorough review of the full ESG report and accompanying data for all three categories (Environmental, Social, and Governance).

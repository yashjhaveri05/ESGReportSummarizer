Please provide me with the Social and Governance sections from Amazon's ESG report so I can complete the analysis and generate a comprehensive summary for you.  

Once you share that information, I will:

1. **Analyze the text and data:** I will identify key themes and challenges related to the company's social and governance performance. 
2. **Summarize key issues:** I will pinpoint the most significant issues the company faces in these areas.
3. **Outline proposed solutions:** I will detail the strategies and initiatives the company has implemented or plans to implement to address these issues, including specific goals, targets, or commitments made.
4. **Include relevant metrics:** I will incorporate data points to support my analysis.

I look forward to reviewing the information and providing you with a clear, concise, and insightful summary of Amazon's ESG performance.

Meta's 2024 Sustainability Report outlines a strong commitment to environmental responsibility and robust governance practices for driving sustainable initiatives. The company aims to achieve net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, emphasizing decarbonization through renewable energy adoption and water stewardship by restoring more water than it consumes.  Strong governance is evident with the Audit and Risk Oversight Committee (AROC) overseeing sustainability initiatives and receiving direct briefings from senior leadership.

However, the report lacks concrete data on environmental progress and social impact strategies. While it mentions a focus on responsible supply chain practices, details about labor practices, diversity and inclusion, and community engagement are absent. 


**ESG Score:**
Environmental: **6/10** - Strong ambitions but lacking quantifiable data on progress.
Social: **5/10** - Limited information on social impact strategies and programs.
Governance: **8/10** - Robust governance structure with senior leadership involvement, but needs more transparent reporting of outcomes.
Total: **6.3/10**
